Assessing Predictability of Stock Market Returns with Macroeconomic Variables by Country Economic Profile

Read "Research Project (Emre Asci and Jia Yi Ong).pdf" for project report.

We construct economic profiles by fitting principal components on high-dimensional data (including HDI, GNI, and labor statistics) for countries around the world and clustering them. By analyzing the impact of indicators on the direction of stock market indices for different economic profiles, we found no clear consistency in the top predictors of major stock index returns for countries in the same clusters. This provides some evidence that the importance of predictors is country-specific and not dependent on economic profiles that are characterized by a summary of general indexes. This also means governments/investors belonging to one country may only obtain limited insights into the process of their home country's index by extrapolating from another country's index movement, even when both countries have similar economic profiles.
